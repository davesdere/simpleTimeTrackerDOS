# simpleTimeTrackerDOS
A simple time tracker built in DOS batch language

I built this to refresh my memory about DOS batch language, but also because I had collegues who didn't want to install third party software to track their hours.
Everything is local and the code is short enough for you to read it and make sense of it.

## What does it do?
It is basically starts the software you need to be working on and log the time and the date you started it.
You can also add notes from the DOS interface. It's usefull when debugging or intermittent working.
The basic DOS menu keeps you distraction free.

Before using it you will need to edit the file to put the path of your files. You can read in the comments.
You can edit the file with notepad or any text editor.(You should probably use notepad in case you use another text editor that encodes in UTF8. No bugs reported but just in case.)

 ## Will this be improved?
 There's no plan on adding features
 
 ## Will you translate it in French?
 Non, Ã§a me tente pas. 
 
 ## Do you have a Linux version?
 I didn't have to make one yet as the Linux users are usually Super Users and would write this in 20 min anyway.
 
 Thanks for reading!
